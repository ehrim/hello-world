# hello-world

Hey all,

I'm stupid new to this, but I at least know that I'm typing into a coding file right now. Notepad ++, thanks for the heads-up there.
I'm actually better at drawing and writing, not that it's relevant at the moment. But maybe it is... did I mention I'm new to this?
So many words ago...
Anyway, it's awkward if this is read, so I'll stop now.
